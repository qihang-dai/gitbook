# How to solve leetcode yourself

I have been leetcoding for a year, solved around 400 - 500 questions. I learnt algo class, from binary search to dynamic programming. Learnt some small techs like prefixsum. However i still find myself not capable of solving leetcode questions or company OA questions myself. I fall into some traps:

1. can't figure out a way to solve the problem. then look at some dicussion solution, for so long, and finally i think myself understand it and rewrite it. The truth is i only know the result but don't know how these solutions are created in the mind.
2. I figure out a way, a no-complete way, a not perfect way. then i hush to write it, passed some example test, then boom! Spent hours but still can't get it all passed (like most time in codesignal or hackerrank). Then i looked at the solution, notice somthing, copy paste, then it passed.

But wait, why you didnt notice the missing thing when you wrote yourself? why you can't even figure out a plan for the problem? That's the missing part of many leetcoder who grind for a job, and thats really sad cause we spent so much time on it but still didnt gain any ability. Why i cant get an idea about the questions? why i have an right idea but i don't know how to implement it correctly? Lets break it down

I wrote this to help me build that thinking system while leetcode, and hope it helps you as well
